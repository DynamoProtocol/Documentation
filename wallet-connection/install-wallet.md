# üåê Connect to Platform

Now that you have a wallet installed, let's connect it to Dynamo AI and get you ready to use AI services.

## Before You Connect

### Pre-Connection Checklist

- ‚úÖ Wallet is installed and set up
- ‚úÖ You have a small amount of ETH for transaction fees
- ‚úÖ Wallet is unlocked and ready
- ‚úÖ You're on the official Dynamo AI website

{% hint style="info" %}
**First Connection**: The process takes about 2 minutes and only needs to be done once per device.
{% endhint %}

---

## Step-by-Step Connection

### Step 1: Visit Dynamo AI

1. **Go to**: [ai.dynamo.zone](https://ai.dynamo.zone)
2. **Verify URL**: Ensure you're on the official site
3. **Check security**: Look for the lock icon in your browser

### Step 2: Initiate Connection

1. **Locate "Connect Wallet"**: Top-right corner of the page
2. **Click the button**: This opens the wallet selection modal
3. **Choose your wallet**: Select MetaMask or your preferred option

### Step 3: Approve Connection

When you click connect, MetaMask will popup:

1. **Review permissions**: See what Dynamo AI is requesting
2. **Select account**: Choose which wallet account to connect
3. **Click "Connect"**: Approve the connection request

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Permission Review**: Dynamo AI only requests permission to see your wallet address and request transactions. We never request access to move funds automatically.
{% endhint %}

### Step 4: Sign Authentication Message

After connecting, you'll be prompted to sign a message:

1. **Message appears**: "Authenticate to Dynamo AI: [timestamp]"
2. **Click "Sign"**: This proves you own the wallet
3. **No cost**: Signing messages is free - no gas fees

#### Why Sign a Message?

- **Security**: Proves you control the wallet
- **Authentication**: Creates a secure session
- **No risk**: Signing doesn't give access to your funds
- **Standard practice**: Used by all reputable Web3 applications

## Managing Your Connection

---

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

### Connection Failed

**Wallet popup doesn't appear:**

- Ensure MetaMask is unlocked
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if popup was blocked by browser

**"Transaction rejected" error:**

- You clicked "Reject" instead of "Connect"
- Try connecting again
- Make sure you're approving, not rejecting

### Network Issues

**Wrong network error:**

- Click "Switch Network" when prompted
- Manually switch to Arbitrum in MetaMask
- Refresh page after switching

**Network not found:**

- Approve adding Arbitrum when prompted
- Add network details manually if needed
- Contact support if problems persist

### Authentication Problems

**Signature request fails:**

- Make sure wallet is unlocked
- Don't reject the signature request
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting

**"Authentication expired":**

- Your session timed out (normal after 8 hours)
- Simply reconnect to create a new session
- No need to do anything special

---

## Security During Connection

### What to Verify

- ‚úÖ **Official URL**: Only connect on ai.dynamo.zone
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS connection**: Look for lock icon in browser
- ‚úÖ **Reasonable permissions**: We only request basic access
- ‚úÖ **No unexpected prompts**: We won't ask for seed phrases

### Red Flags - Never Do This

- ‚ùå **Enter seed phrase**: Dynamo AI never asks for this
- ‚ùå **Send ETH first**: No upfront payments required
- ‚ùå **Download software**: Everything works in your browser
- ‚ùå **Share private keys**: Keep these secret always

**Phishing Protection**: Always double-check the URL. Scammers create fake sites with similar addresses.
